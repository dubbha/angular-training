# Angular Training

## Task 8. Forms
- CheckoutComponent using Reactive Form with required, email and pattern-based validations
- Class-generated error messages, with full support for the initial touch-and-blur scenario
- Cross-field case-insensitive validation of emails, with a nice double-arrow error tooltip
- Conditional adjustment of validation rules depending on the deliveryRequired switch
- FormArray of mobiles allowing to add and delete mobiles, individual error tracking
- ProductCreatorComponent using Reactive Form with validations and a subform for materials
- ProductEditorComponent using Template-driven Form for contrast
- AuthComponent using very basic Reactive Form
- Validations run moment configured to fire onBlur, onChange
- Not using FormBuilder because of issues like [updateOn](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/19163)
